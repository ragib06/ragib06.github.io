I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) working under the supervision of Professor [Elena Zheleva](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~elena/). I'm interested in developing machine leanring and causal infernece models for relational data. My current research is focused on causal structure learning for relational data.

My most recent work involves building robust Learning-To-Rank systems that can recover from selection bias from user feedback. We proposed a method to overcome it using Heckman two step method which is a popular selection bias correction method in statistics. 

I have completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2012. Prior to coming to UIC, I worked as a software company at Dhaka where I developed features for popular online social games.
