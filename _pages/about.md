I recently finished my PhD at the Department of Computer Science in University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) working under the supervision of Professor [Elena Zheleva](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~elena/) and looking forward to join [Pinterest Inc.](https://www.pinterest.com/) as a Machine Learning engineer. I'm interested in the application of machine learning and causal inference on relational data. My PhD research was focused on causal discovery from relational data in the presence of feedback loops.

In my previous life, I worked as a software engineer at Disney Interactive, Bangladesh where I developed features for popular online social games. Before that, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), 2012.
